This repo contains some scripts used for facilitating development of custom firmware for the Technics SX-KN5000 musical keyboard.

You should also look at https://github.com/felipesanches/TLCS900_ExecTrace because there's some more KN5000 dev-tools there, including a disassembler with specific knowledge of the KN5000 system.
